Use Case: Viral and Fake News Data Lineage Tracking
Objective: Track the lifecycle of social media posts or news articles to understand their origin, transformations (like edits or re-shares), propagation paths, and engagement metrics that contribute to virality or misinformation.

Entities to Model:

Post/Article: The original social media content piece or news article.

User/Account: Social media users or accounts sharing or interacting.

Engagement Metrics: Likes, shares, comments, impressions, etc.

Propagation Events: Actions like shares, retweets, replies, quotes.

Verification/Fact-Check Status: Whether the content has been flagged or verified.

Source/Platform: Origin platform or data source.

Relationships:

User creates Post.

User shares/retweets Post (linking propagation).

Post modifies/quotes another Post (transformation).

Post flagged/verified by Fact-Check entity.

Engagement metrics associated with Post.

Example of Tracking Flow:
A news article originates on a website (Source).

It is shared first by a user on Twitter (User creates Post).

Other users retweet, comment, or quote it (Propagation Events).

Some versions of the post are edited or accompanied by misinformation tags (Transformations, Fact-Check).

Engagement metrics update continuously to reflect virality levels.
